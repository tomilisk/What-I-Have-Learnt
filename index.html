        <p>My name is <strong>Ifeoluwatomi Abiodun-lisk</strong>, I enrolled at <b>Stutern</b> to learn
            <em>Software Engineer</em>.</p>    
        <p>In my three weeks of being here, I have learnt a lot about
        <i>Git and Github</i> which has been something I have struggled with in the
        past.</p> 
        <p>Also, we are being thought Html, which is the main reason for this
            assignment. Our teachers want to how much we understand. Well for me, I
            now know how to do make <h1>Headers like this</h1> and <h6>even smaller ones like
            this</h6> I also know how to <i>italise</i> words, <u>underline</u> them, <b>bolden</b> them. Looking forward to the other things I will learn.</p>
